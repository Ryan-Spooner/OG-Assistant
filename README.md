# OG Assistant
...An OBS and GPT-powered AI assistant.

## Summary
OGA uses the OBS WebSocket API to record system audio. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o API to perform content analysis. It is cross-platform, supporting Mac, Windows, and Linux, and runs in a docker container exposed via [Twingate Connectors](https://twingate.com/docs/connectors) to the end user.

### Why OGA
I attend a lot of meetings. My coworkers attend a lot of meetings. The need for a full-featured AI assistant to lessen the cognitive strain is almost painful. While a host of solutions exist, they are expensive. The ***free*** services hide their best tools in a premium-tier sub.

I want a cheap and performant assistant to share with others at zero cost to them. I want it to integrate with my workflow seamlessly.

To get what you want, it's best to do it yourself. OGA is a labor of love--a mission set to crush the noise and boost the signal.

## Planned Features

### Multi-Modal Support
A text-audio system will take you far. But pictures and objects surround us, organic, tangible, and replete with meaning that is--at times--ineffable. Given that value, and that Tech Giants are sus (I'm looking at you, Recall), a sure upgrade for OGA is support for image and video.

### Integration with Fabric
Daniel Miessler's open-source [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) makes it easy for people to integrate AI into everyday tasks. Adding it as a module within OGA is a win.

### Local to Flagship AI System
Foundation models equipped with long context windows and RAG are indispensable. However, that power is no panacea. The missing piece is a performant local system without internet dependence. Using FOSS models loaded onto platforms like Open Web UI upholds data sovereignty and is great for when even Starlink isn't an option.

### 2nd Brain Implementation
Tiago Forte sparked a movement that revisits how we learn and act on information. Creating, planning, and abstracting is what our minds do best. Let machines memorize endless facts. The first step to a modern 2nd brain entails pipelines that capture and process notes, research, projects, and everything else. Next, Present those in a clean, intuitive format. We have arrived once interoperability, collaboration, and automation are included.
