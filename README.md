# OG Assistant
...An **O**BS and **G**PT powered AI assistant.

---

## Summary
OGA uses the OBS WebSocket API to record host system audio, and leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o API to perform content analysis. It is cross-platform, with support for Mac, Windows, and Linux OS. To achieve that, it runs in a docker container exposed via [Twingate Connectors](https://twingate.com/docs/connectors) to the end user.

### Why OGA
I attend a lot of meetings. My coworkers attend a lot of meetings. The need for a full-featured AI assistant to lessen the cognitive strain is almost painful. While a host of solutions exist, they are usually had at a steep cost. *Free* services hide the most helpful tools in a premium-tier sub.

I want a cheap, performant assistant to share with others at zero cost. I want it to seamlessly integrate with my workflow, and grok my life in general (insofar it is plain-text encoded).

To get what you want, its best to do it yourself. So, this project is a labor of love and pragmatism to lower the noise and amplify the signal.

## Planned Features

### Multi-Modal Support
A text-audio system suffices for much. However, glyphs, signs and symbols are ubiquitous and replete with meaning that is, at times, ineffable. Given the value proposition and fact Tech Giants are suspect to perform the task--I'm looking at you, Recall--the next big step for OGA is support for image and video.

### Integration with Fabric
Daniel Miessler's fantastic and open-source [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) is a great interface, making AI tooling more relatable and easy to integrate into everyday life.

### Local to Flagship AI System
Interacting with a compressed model of all knowledge in my browser is a 10x superpower. Foundation AIs equipped with long context windows and RAG are indispensable. However, that power is no panacea. Performant local resources complete an AI system. These don't need an internet connection to function and they help preserve our data-sovereignty. 

### 2nd Brain Implementation
Tiago Forte sparked a movement revisiting how humans learn from and act on information. He teaches how we can spend more time creating and in deep contemplation, and less memorizing endless facts. Pipelines that capture and process my notes, research, projects--and everything in between--then present them to me in a clean, intuitive interface, is the first step. Interoperability with other applications, collaboration, and automation get us up the mountain.
