# OG Assistant
...An **O**BS and **G**PT powered AI assistant.

## Summary
OGA uses the OBS WebSocket API to record system audio. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o API to perform content analysis. It is cross-platform, supporting Mac, Windows, and Linux, and runs in a docker container exposed via [Twingate Connectors](https://twingate.com/docs/connectors) to the end user.

### Why OGA
I attend a lot of meetings. My coworkers attend a lot of meetings. The need for a full-featured AI assistant to lessen the cognitive strain is almost painful. While a host of solutions exist, they are expensive. The ***free*** services hide their best tools in a premium-tier sub.

I want a cheap and performant assistant to share with others at zero cost. I want it to seamlessly integrate with my workflow. To get what you want, its best to do it yourself. So, this project is a labor of love and pragmatism: Squash the noise and boost the signal.

## Planned Features

### Multi-Modal Support
A text-audio system will take you far. But glyphs, signs and symbols are all around us, replete with meaning that is, at times, ineffable. Given that value and fact Tech Giants are sus--I'm looking at you, Recall--the next big step for OGA is support for image and video.

### Integration with Fabric
Daniel Miessler's fantastic and open-source [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) makes it easy for people to integrate AI into thier everyday tasks. Adding it as a module within OGA is a win.

### Local to Flagship AI System
Foundation models equipped with long context windows and RAG are indispensable. However, that power is no panacea. A performant local system with no internet dependance is a 10x upgrade. Using open-source models on platforms like Open Web UI upholds our data sovereignty and is great for situations where even Starlink is unavailable.

### 2nd Brain Implementation
Tiago Forte sparked a movement that revisits how we learn and act on information. Creating, planning, and abstracting are what are minds do best. Let the machines memorize all the endless facts. To create a modern 2nd brain, pipelines to capture and process my notes, research, projects--and everything in between--is the first step. Then I need everything presented in a clean, intuitive interface. Add interoperability, collaboration, and automation, and we're cookin' with gas.
